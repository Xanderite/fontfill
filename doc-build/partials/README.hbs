Best-fit any string into a box of arbitrary dimensions. Its a great solution for dynamic display text, responsive websites or a combination of both. Its pretty fast too, resizing a box will look smooth. It also implements a reactive state, so its possible to watch for changes to the fit, such as when the box is resized.

## Install

```
npm install --save fontfill
```

## Getting Started

The primary interface for this library is through a class called `AutoFittingText` which is detailed below. This package comes with multiple builds that are suitable for a range of use cases, and build tools.

### ECMAScript2015

This library was written in ECMAScript2015 and the source can be referenced directly like so:

``` es6
import { AutoFittingText } from 'fontfill/src'
```

You will need your own bundler and transpiler for this to work.

### ES5

If you are using your own bundler, but don't want to setup an es6 transpiler
use the transpiled to ES5 version of this library like so:

``` js
var AutoFittingText = require('fontfill').AutoFittingText
```

### commonjs2

If you have some requirement for a standalone commonjs2 module:
``` js
var AutoFittingText = require('fontfill').AutoFittingText
```

### Global

if you want to access this module globally
``` js
var AutoFittingText = window.fontfill.AutoFittingText
```

## Example

Here is a pretty straightforward example for a one-time fit

``` es6
import { AutoFittingText } from 'fontfill/src'

const targetString = `Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 11032.`

const targetDiv = document.body.querySelector('.target-div')
const bestFit = new AutoFittingText(targetDiv.width, targetDiv.height, {
  targetString: targetString,
  family: targetDiv.style.fontFamily
  lineHeight: targetDiv.style.lineHeight // this should be a scalar
})

targetDiv.innerHTML = bestFit.metrics.lines.join('<br/>')
targetDiv.style.fontSize = bestFit.metrics.fontSize
```

### Demo

There is a demo available at `demo/index.html` folder, that requires that the project be built.

You can build the project by running:

```
npm install && npm run build
```

in the root of the project directory.

### Development

There are currently 0 unit tests, only an e2e test to check the project has built correctly.
Currently I won't be accepting any PRs since the code is still in a prototypical state.


```npm run dev```

Will watch for changes and rebuild as neccessary, it will also host the `demo/dev.html` project at `localhost:8081/demo/dev.html`, which will auto reload on changes to the library.
